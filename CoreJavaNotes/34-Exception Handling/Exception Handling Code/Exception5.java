//1. if programmer has handled the exception will matter
//go to default exception handler?
//  Ans- No, it will go to default exception handler when user 
//       not handled.

//--> there are many exceptions. parent of all exceptions is
//Exception.
//ArithmetiEexception
//NegativeArraySizeException
//ArrayeIndexOutOfBound Exception

//-> Exception is parent of all Exception
//-> if we write Exception in catch block then it handles any 
//type of exception.
//eg: 
//	catch(Exception e)
//	{
//		System.out.println("You're trying to divide by zero illogical");
//		
//	}

//Example-1:

import java.util.Scanner;

	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
	
//	 -->try block
	  try { 
//	  1. Connection to calc application
	     System.out.println("connection to calc is established");
				
//	  2. taking input form console
		 Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
		 System.out.println("enter num1 to divide");
		 int num1=scan.nextInt();
			    
		 System.out.println("enter num2 to divide");
	     int num2=scan.nextInt();
			    
		 int res=num1/num2;
	     System.out.println("the result"+res);
