# RequestDisptching or Servlete COmponent Mechanism
forward 
include

In Java Servlets, the `RequestDispatcher` interface provides two primary mechanisms for dispatching requests to other resources within a web application: `forward` and `include`. These mechanisms are crucial for modularizing web application development and enabling various components to work together seamlessly.

### `RequestDispatcher` Interface

The `RequestDispatcher` interface defines an object that can forward a request to another resource or include the content of another resource. The interface is obtained from a `ServletRequest` object.

```java
RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("path_to_resource");
```

### `forward` Method

The `forward` method forwards a request from a servlet to another resource (such as another servlet, JSP, or HTML file) on the server. The browser is unaware of this server-side forward; the URL in the browser address bar remains unchanged.

#### Key Points:
- The `forward` method is performed on the server side.
- The client (browser) is unaware of the forward.
- The URL in the address bar does not change.
- It is used when you want to pass control to another resource and you don't need the original servlet to continue processing the request.

#### Usage Example:
```java
RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("path_to_resource");
dispatcher.forward(request, response);
```

#### Scenario:
You have a login form, and upon successful login, you forward the request to a dashboard servlet.

### `include` Method

The `include` method includes the content of another resource (such as another servlet, JSP, or HTML file) in the response. The inclusion is performed at the point where the `include` method is called.

#### Key Points:
- The `include` method includes the content of another resource in the response.
- It is used when you want to include the output of another resource within the current response.
- The URL in the address bar remains unchanged.
- The control returns to the original servlet after the included resource is processed.

#### Usage Example:
```java
RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("path_to_resource");
dispatcher.include(request, response);
```

#### Scenario:
You have a servlet that dynamically generates part of the content and includes a header and footer JSP file for a consistent layout.

### Code Example: Combining Both Mechanisms

Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating the use of both `forward` and `include` in a servlet:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        
        // Including header JSP
        RequestDispatcher header = request.getRequestDispatcher("header.jsp");
        header.include(request, response);

        // Perform some logic or processing
        String action = request.getParameter("action");
        if ("forward".equals(action)) {
            // Forward to another servlet
            RequestDispatcher forwardDispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("anotherServlet");
            forwardDispatcher.forward(request, response);
            return;
        } else {
            // Include some content
            RequestDispatcher content = request.getRequestDispatcher("content.jsp");
            content.include(request, response);
        }

        // Including footer JSP
        RequestDispatcher footer = request.getRequestDispatcher("footer.jsp");
        footer.include(request, response);
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **`forward`**: Forwards request to another resource, browser URL remains the same, control does not return to the original servlet.
- **`include`**: Includes content of another resource within the response, browser URL remains the same, control returns to the original servlet after inclusion.

These mechanisms allow for flexible and modular web application development by enabling components to delegate tasks and share content.
