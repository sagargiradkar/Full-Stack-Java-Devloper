//Note::Every method present inside the interface is abstract, but in abstract class
//also we take only abstract methods then 
//what is the need of interface concept?

//we can replace interface with abstract class, 
//but it is not a good programming practice

//example: vacancy for sweeping role for sweepers and higher officials

//ans:
