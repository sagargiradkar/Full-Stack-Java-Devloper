//									70

//->Checking whether key=100 in collection.
//->7 objects are there in TreeSet 
//->for searching key here we are having 7 comparisons.
//->Time complexity- O(n)
//->these structure we call it as Skewed tree.


//Balance Binary Search Tree

// =>Conclusion
//->if we store data in TreeSet it follows Binary search tree data structure.
//->Binary data structure will applied to the added data.
//->by following data structure if data is stored if end result 
//  is balanced search tree. Then searching operation is good.
//->after store data if end result is not balanced binary 
//  search tree rather skewed search tree in that case even using
//  TreeSet the searching takes time complexity O(n).
//->maximum number of comparisions are made.
//->Order insertion is not maintained TreeSet.
//->it gives the result in the form of ascending sorted order.
//->if we are storing data in TreeSet at the end final result is 
//  balanced Binary search tree then it is good perfrom searching 
//  operation.
//->if end result is Skewed Binary search tree it is not good 
//  perform searching operation. it also takes same comparisons like
//  other classes.
