//2. join() Method
//->If the thread has to wait untill the other thread finishes
//  its execution then we need to go for join().

//->see picture at 1:51:00 
//Example-
//scenario-1
//            Hyder sir(java)       	          Nithin sir(JEE)
//                  |             		     |
//       10:00am    |                       10:00am  |      
//          |       | t1(waiting state) 	     |     |t2
//          |       |                          |     |
//        10:45     |                       10:45    |
//                                             |
//              Person-A                    12:00am Person-B
//                                                   |
//                                                   | t1.join()


//->hyder sir and nithin sir taking classes for different 
//  batches.
//->there are common firend in batch.
//->sessions are take from 10:00am to 10:45am
//->in case of nithin sir said session will be 
//  extended to 12:00am.
//->two common friends staying in same PG
//->Person A waits upto 12:00am for person-B after that the
//  will continue journey.
//->changing names to t1 and t2.
//->Let t2 finishes exection then t1 joins with t2. 
//                   t1.join()
//->t1 is in waiting state and joins with t2.
//->t2 calling join method. after t1 comes t2 joins.

//scenario-2
//->Another person-c approched person-A while in waiting state.
//->Person-c is disturbing Person-A. then Person-A and C will
//  continue there journey. 
//->it is an interruption.
//->it is called interruptedException.

// public final void join() throws InterruptedException

//=>When Interrupted exception is thrown?
//->Note: While one thread is in waiting state and if one 
//  more thread interupts then it would result in 
//  "InterruptedException".InterruptedException is 
//  checkedException which should always be handled.



//waiting case of t1
//1. till class gets over t1 waits.
//2. exactly 30min t1 waits
//3.exactly 30min 45 sec t1 will wait
//->these senarios may seen while waitng.
//->after waiting state is over then super state.

//->we have three methods to map.

//=>Prototype of join()
//1. public final void join() throws InterruptedException
//2. public final void join(long ms)throws InterruptedException
//3. public final void join(long ms,int ns)throws InterruptedException

//->ms-millil seconds
//->ns-nano seconds
