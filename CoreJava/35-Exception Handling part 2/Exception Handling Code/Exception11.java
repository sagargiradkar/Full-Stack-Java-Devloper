//2. Duck the Exception(throws keyword)-
// ->we can also duck the exception.
// ->we are not handling we are giving responsibility 
//   to caller.
// ->here in alpha1 exception is not handled by try catch.
// ->here responsibility is given to caller.
// ->it is always recommended if handler is not provided
//     in the method signature please write 
//     "throws Exception name"
//    eg: void alpha1() throws ArithmeticException{
//        
//
//        }

//-> in this case caller of alpha method will not go and 
//   check entire body.
//->in programming world a look programmer don't want to 
//  handle don't handle it at least be mature and responsible.
//->telling method signature throws whatever type exception
//  so that caller of alpha(beta) when he calls alpha
//  get to know alpha method is throwing exception by 
//  seeing method signature.
//-> caller of alpha(beta) will not check the whole body.
//-> if method beta also not handled then tell 
//   caller of beta(main) by writing which exception that 
//   code in method throws.
//    example: void beta1() throws ArithmeticException
//	{
//	
//	}
//->whoever going to call beta method they will be cautious.
//  beta method throws exception and caller method wil be 
//  cautious and provide the handler(try catch).

//conclusion
//  telling the caller that these exception may occur if it is
//  invoked. write in method signature.

//output:
//	connection to calc is established

//	100
//	enter num2 to divide
//	0
//	Exception finally handled in main


//->the exception which is occurring is at runtime.
//->it is unchecked.
//->for unchecked exception it is highly recommended to handle 
// it should not duck it.
//->if we think exception any occur it is developer 
//  Responsibility. 
//->to handle the exception.
//->it is good recommendation to handle the code.
