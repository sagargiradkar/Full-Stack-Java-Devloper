What is Class And Objects 

Today's topic of discussion
---------------------------
Introduction to oops(classws and Objects) -> Navin Sir
Types of Variables
    Division - 1
        a.primitive variables
        b.reference variables
        c.static variables
JVM Area for execution
    a.MethodAred
    b.Heap Area
    c.Stack Area
    d.PC-Register
    e.Native method Area

OOPs
------
It is actually theoty concept,which is implemented by many Programming languages like c++,Java,Python,.....
Any real time Problem can be solved if we follow oop's principles.
In OOPs , while solving the problem 
    1.We need to first make the Objects.
    2.Every Object we mark should have 2 parts
            a.HAS-PART /Fields/attributes/(store the information as variables)
            b.DOES-PART /Behaviours(represent them as method)
    3.To represent an Object , first we need have a blueprint of an Object.



What is Objects ?
        Physical existance of any element we say as Object.
            eg: book,Car,Computer,Dog,Students......


What is HAS_PART And What is DOES-Part of an object represents ?

    HAS-PART => Indicates what it can hold
    DOES-PART => Indicates what it can do 
        eg.Student
            |=>sid,name,age,gender,email,address(variables/identifier)
            |=>play,stydy,drink,sleep(Sleep) (methods)

What is blueprint in Java and how to represent it ?
    in Java to represent a blueprint we have a reserve word called "class" .
    Conventions followed by Java devlopers while writting a class is 
        a.className should be in "PascalConvention" .
            eg:BufferReader,FileReader,InputStream,OutputStrim,String
        b.variables are represent in "camelCase"
            eg:regNo,firstName,lastName,length,studId,javaFullStack,..........
        c.methods are represeted in "camelCase",
            eg:toUpper(),toLower(),toString(),nextInt(),.....



class Student {
    int sid,
    String name;
    int age;
    char gender;
    String address;

    void play(){}
    void study(){}
    void 
    
}





realtime example : BookMyShow
        Objects : Person , Ticket , TicketIssuer ,CinemaHall , 3D-glass,Screen ,......

Note :  Software measns collection of many programs
        Programs means set of instructions.
        To write instructions we need to have a languages.
