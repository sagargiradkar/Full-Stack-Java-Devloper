//9th Dec Live Class Collection in Java | I did on 6/6/2023 

//1. Collections-
//->framework, API, Hirerachy

//=>Collections in Java
//->The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an 
//architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

//->Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you 
//  perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, 
//  manipulation, and deletion.

//->Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java 
//  Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, 
//  Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList,
//  PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).


//2. Array
//->To storing data we use variable.
//->for large data it is difficult to store in varaibles.
//->List of information or large data is stored in Array.
//->Array=> Indexed based data structure.
//          Large volume of data
//          single variable
//->Array is indexed based data structure where we can store
//  Large volume of similar data or Homogeneous data.

//=>3. Disadvantages of Array
//->Array cannot store hetrogeneous data. 
//->size is fixed 
//->it demands Contigous memory locations.
//->we do not have inbuilt methods to perform operations.
//->directly we cannot perform operations.
//->indirectly we can do by using built-in class called Arrays.


 

//4. Problem faced in storing Large volume of data
//->Java provides in built classes. lack of uniformity is seen 
//  in those in built classes. 
//->they failed to manage large volume of data.
//->to perform operations on the large volume of data was 
// difficult in those days.


//5. Collection API
//->java is open source.
//->joshua->computer scientist
//  he obsevered the problem and contributed the solution.
//->he created one API or entire hierarchy.
//->hierarchy consists of collection of Interfaces and Classes.
//->Each classes have many in-built classes.
//->he proposed this solution to sun micro system team and named 
//  it as collection.
//->from Java 1.2 Collection API got added in java.
//->it is an API, hierachy and framework.
//->someone already coded and developer has to use it.

//->Entire hierarchy it is collection major 7 classes 
//1. ArrayList ->Inbuilt class
//2. LinkedList
//3. Array Deque
//4. Priority Queue
//5. Treeset
//6. Hashset
//7. LinkedHashset



//->Above classes divided using three interface.
//1. List(I)-  ArrayList, LinkedList
//2. Queue(I)- Array Dequeue, priority
//3. set(I)  - Treeset, Hashset, LinkedHashset

//->Map 
//->Legacy classes
//->Concept of Generics

//->Each classes follow it's own data structure to store data.
//->In there own way there store data
//->by this performing operation become easy.
//->to perform operation there are so many in built methods are 
//  persent.


//->All above classes are present in util package.
//->Arrays, String  are present in lang package.
//->To use any of the collection classes we need to import.
//eg: import java.util.*;
//->In collection whatever data you add it stores as an object.
