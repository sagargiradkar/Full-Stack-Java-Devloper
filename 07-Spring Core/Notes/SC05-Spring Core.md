It looks like you're trying to download Spring Framework JAR files. You can download them directly from the Spring repository, but a more common way to manage dependencies in a Java project is to use a build tool like Maven or Gradle. This way, you don't need to download JAR files manually. Instead, you can specify the dependencies in your project's configuration file, and the build tool will handle the rest.

### Using Maven
If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.10</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
</dependency>
```

You can replace `spring-core` with the specific Spring module you need (e.g., `spring-web`, `spring-context`, etc.).

### Using Gradle
If you're using Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework:spring-core:5.3.10' // Use the latest version
}
```

### Manual Download
If you prefer to download the JAR files manually, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Spring Releases Repository](https://repo.spring.io/ui/native/release/org/springframework/spring/).

2. Navigate through the directories to find the specific Spring module and version you need.

3. Download the JAR files and include them in your project's classpath.

Using a build tool is generally recommended, as it simplifies dependency management and ensures you always have the correct versions. Let me know if you need help setting up Maven or Gradle in your project!
