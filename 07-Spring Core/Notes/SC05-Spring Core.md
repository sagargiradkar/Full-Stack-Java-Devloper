# IOC Project Spring Bean ID

## Introduction
In Spring, the Inversion of Control (IoC) container manages the lifecycle and configuration of application objects. These objects are known as Spring Beans.

## Defining a Spring Bean ID
A Spring Bean ID is a unique identifier for a bean in the Spring IoC container. It is used to reference the bean within the container.

## Example
Here is an example of defining a Spring Bean with an ID in an XML configuration file:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyClass">
   <!-- bean properties go here -->
    </bean>

</beans>
```

In this example:
- `id="myBean"`: This is the unique identifier for the bean.
- `class="com.example.MyClass"`: This specifies the fully qualified class name of the bean.

## Conclusion
Using a unique Spring Bean ID is essential for managing and referencing beans within the Spring IoC container. It ensures that each bean can be uniquely identified and accessed as needed.
