# Detailed Notes on CallableStatement and Related Concepts

## CallableStatement in Java

### Introduction

In Java, `CallableStatement` is used to execute stored procedures and functions in a database. It extends the `PreparedStatement` interface and provides the capability to execute SQL stored procedures which can be precompiled and stored in the database.

### Statement, PreparedStatement, and CallableStatement

#### Statement

- **Purpose**: Used for executing a static SQL query.
- **Example**:
    ```java
    Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
    String sql = "SELECT pid, pname, price, qty FROM product WHERE pid = 1";
    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);
    ```
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Simple to Use**: Directly execute SQL queries.
    - **Vulnerable to SQL Injection**: String concatenation makes it prone to SQL injection.
    - **Performance**: Parsed and compiled every time it is executed.

#### PreparedStatement

- **Purpose**: Used for executing parameterized SQL queries.
- **Example**:
    ```java
    String sql = "SELECT pid, pname, price, qty FROM product WHERE pid = ?";
    PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
    pstmt.setInt(1, 1);
    ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
    ```
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Parameterized Queries**: Supports parameters, making it safer against SQL injection.
    - **Precompiled**: SQL statement is precompiled, improving performance.
    - **Flexibility**: Allows dynamic setting of parameters.

#### CallableStatement

- **Purpose**: Used for executing stored procedures.
- **Example**:
    ```java
    CallableStatement cstmt = connection.prepareCall("{call P_GET_PRODUCT_DETAILS_BY_ID(?, ?, ?, ?)}");
    cstmt.setInt(1, 3); // Setting the input parameter
    cstmt.registerOutParameter(2, Types.VARCHAR); // Registering the output parameters
    cstmt.registerOutParameter(3, Types.INTEGER);
    cstmt.registerOutParameter(4, Types.INTEGER);
    cstmt.execute();
    
    // Retrieving the output parameters
    String name = cstmt.getString(2);
    int rate = cstmt.getInt(3);
    int qty = cstmt.getInt(4);
    ```
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Stored Procedures Execution**: Specifically designed for executing stored procedures.
    - **Complex Transactions**: Suitable for complex transactions involving multiple operations.
    - **Security**: Provides an additional layer of abstraction and security.

### Stored Procedures in Databases

#### Definition

A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements that perform a specific task, stored permanently in a database.

#### Advantages

1. **Reusability**: Like methods in programming, stored procedures can be called multiple times.
2. **Performance**: Precompiled, which can improve execution speed.
3. **Security**: Abstracts the underlying SQL code, providing an additional security layer.
4. **Maintainability**: Centralizes SQL code, making it easier to manage and update.

#### Example

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE `ineuron`.`P_GET_PRODUCT_DETAILS_BY_ID`(
    IN id INT, 
    OUT NAME VARCHAR(20), 
    OUT rate INT, 
    OUT qnt INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT pname, price, qty INTO NAME, rate, qnt 
    FROM product 
    WHERE pid = id;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

### Characteristics of Stored Procedures

1. **Permanently Stored**: Stored in the database for reuse.
2. **Created by DBA**: Typically created by Database Administrators (DBAs).
3. **Database-Specific Languages**:
    - **Oracle**: PL/SQL
    - **MySQL**: Stored Procedure Language
    - **Microsoft SQL Server**: Transact-SQL (T-SQL)

### Parameters in Stored Procedures

Stored procedures can accept parameters to make them dynamic and flexible. There are three types of parameters:

1. **IN Parameters**: Used to pass input values to the stored procedure.
2. **OUT Parameters**: Used to return output values from the stored procedure.
3. **INOUT Parameters**: Used to pass input values and also return output values.

### Example with Parameters

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE `ineuron`.`P_GET_PRODUCT_DETAILS_BY_ID`(
    IN id INT, 
    OUT NAME VARCHAR(20), 
    OUT rate INT, 
    OUT qnt INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT pname, price, qty INTO NAME, rate, qnt 
    FROM product 
    WHERE pid = id;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

In this example, the stored procedure `P_GET_PRODUCT_DETAILS_BY_ID` accepts an `id` as an input parameter and returns the product name, price, and quantity as output parameters.

### Calling Stored Procedures

To call a stored procedure in MySQL, use the following syntax:

```sql
CALL P_GET_PRODUCT_DETAILS_BY_ID(3, @name, @rate, @qty);

SELECT @name, @rate, @qty;
```

### SQL Statement vs. PreparedStatement in Java

#### Statement

A `Statement` is used to execute a static SQL query that doesn't accept parameters. The SQL query is written by the Java developer and is executed directly.

**Example:**

```java
Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
String sql = "SELECT pid, pname, price, qty FROM product WHERE pid = 1";
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);
```

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Simple to Use**: Easy to execute static queries.
2. **Vulnerable to SQL Injection**: Since the query is constructed using string concatenation, it is prone to SQL injection attacks.
3. **Performance**: The query is parsed and compiled each time it is executed, which can impact performance for repeated executions.

#### PreparedStatement

A `PreparedStatement` is used to execute parameterized SQL queries. It is more secure and efficient compared to `Statement`.

**Example:**

```java
String sql = "SELECT pid, pname, price, qty FROM product WHERE pid = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
pstmt.setInt(1, 1);
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
```

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Parameterized Queries**: Supports parameters, making it safer against SQL injection.
2. **Precompiled**: The SQL statement is precompiled, which can improve performance for repeated executions.
3. **Flexibility**: Allows setting parameters dynamically, making it more flexible for complex queries.

### Methods in Programming

In programming, methods are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They enhance code reusability and maintainability.

**Example:**

```java
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Code Reusability**: Methods can be called multiple times within a program, reducing code duplication.
2. **Modularity**: Methods break down complex problems into smaller, manageable units.
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and update the code.

### Stored Procedures in Databases

A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements that perform a specific task and are stored permanently in a database. They are similar to methods in programming, providing reusability and efficiency in database operations.

**Definition:**

A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements stored in the database, which can be executed by calling it by name.

**Advantages:**

1. **Reusability**: Similar to methods, stored procedures can be called multiple times, reducing redundancy.
2. **Performance**: Stored procedures are precompiled, which can improve execution speed.
3. **Security**: They provide an additional layer of security by abstracting the underlying SQL code.
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to manage and update SQL code as it is centralized.

**Example:**

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE `ineuron`.`P_GET_PRODUCT_DETAILS_BY_ID`(
    IN id INT, 
    OUT NAME VARCHAR(20), 
    OUT rate INT, 
    OUT qnt INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT pname, price, qty INTO NAME, rate, qnt 
    FROM product 
    WHERE pid = id;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

### Characteristics of Stored Procedures

1. **Permanently Stored**: Stored procedures are stored in the database and can be reused multiple times.
2. **Created by DBA**: Typically created by Database Administrators (DBAs) to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
3. **Database-Specific Languages**: Different databases have their own languages for creating stored procedures:
    - Oracle: PL/SQL
    - MySQL: Stored Procedure Language
    - Microsoft SQL Server: Transact-SQL (T-SQL)

### Parameters in Stored Procedures

Stored procedures can accept parameters to make them dynamic and flexible. There are three types of parameters:

1. **IN Parameters**: Used to pass input values to the stored procedure.
2. **OUT Parameters**: Used to return output values from the stored procedure.
3. **INOUT Parameters**: Used to pass input values and also return output values.

**Example with Parameters:**

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE `ineuron`.`P_GET_PRODUCT_DETAILS_BY_ID`(
    IN id INT, 
    OUT NAME VARCHAR(20), 
    OUT rate INT, 
    OUT qnt INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT pname, price, qty INTO NAME, rate, qnt 
    FROM product 
    WHERE pid = id;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

In this example, the stored procedure `P_GET_PRODUCT_DETAILS_BY_ID` accepts an `id` as an input parameter and returns the product name


Syntax for calling stored procedure from java programm
======================================================
		String storedProcedureCall="{CALL `P_GET_PRODUCT_DETAILS_BY_ID`(?,?,?,?)}";
        cstmt = connection.prepareCall(storedProcedureCall);
			
When jvm encounter the above line , jvm will send the call to database.
DB engine will check whether the specified stored procedure is available or not.
if it is available then it will return CallableStatement object representing that procedure .

Note :

    eg:P_GET_PRODUCT_DETAILS_BY_ID`(?,?,?,?)
    setXXXX() -> available to take care of setting the input values as per the DBengine datatypes.

    eg:setInt(1,id)----------->int
       setString(2,name)------> varchar

Before getting the value from the storedprocedure , we need to register the out variable with java specific datatypes.



Registering the output variables of StoredProcedure
    a.To map the JDBC and Database Specific datatype we need to used some mechanism .
    b.The mechanism used is "JDBC Types" Which is also known as "Bridge Types".

eg:java datatypes ->int 
    JDBC type ->> Types.INTEGER
    DB Datatype -> int / number 

eg:java datatypes -> String
    JDBC type ->> Types.VARCHAR
    DB datatype -> varchar , varchar2

eg:java datatype -> java.util.Date
     JDBC type ->> Types.
    DB datatype -> 
getXXXX() ->available to get the value from the DBE as per the DB specific datatype
        DB (varchar) -------->JAVA(String)



Note ::

To execute to stoed procedure 

StoredProcedure to retrive all records based on the produvt name
===================================================================
DELIMITER $$

CREATE
   
    PROCEDURE `ineuron`.`P_GET_PRODUCT_BY_NAME`(IN name1 varchar(20),IN name2 VARCHAR(20))
    
	BEGIN
		SELECT pid,pname,price.qty FROM products WHERE pname IN (name1,name2);
	END$$

DELIMITER ;

To call store procedure we used the following syntax

CALL `P_GET_PRODUCT_BY_NAME`('fossils','tissit');
