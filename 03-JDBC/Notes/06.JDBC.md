### Statment(I)=>Executing the query (query should be written by the java devloper )
### PreparedStatment(I)=>Exceuting the query(query should be written by the java devloper)

In programming if any code is repeateadly required , we can defined the code inside the method and we can call that method multiple times based on our requirement .
hence forth methods are best reusable component in programming.

Similirly in Database Programming , if any group of sql statments is repeatedly required then we defined those sql statment in a single group and we call that group repeatedly based on oure requirement.

    This group of sql statments that perform a particular task is nothing but "Stored Procedure".
    StoredProcedure is the best reusable component at database level.

StoredProcedure 
    It refers to group of sql statments that perform particular task.

These stored procedures are stored permanently inside database for furthure usage and hence the name "Stored Procedure".
Usually StoredProcedure are created by databaseAdmin(DBA)

Every Database has its own language to create StoredProcedure
    a.Oracle -> PL/SQL
    b.MySQL -> Stored Procedure Language
    c.MicrosoftSQLServer ->Transact SQL(TSQL)

Similar to method stored procedure has its own parameters.
Stored Procedure has 3 Parameters 
    a.IN parameter(to provide input vales)
    b.OUT parameters (to provide output variable)
    c.INOUT parameters (to provide and to collect output)
 

String sqlQuery = "Select pid,pname,price,qty,from product where pid = ?";
