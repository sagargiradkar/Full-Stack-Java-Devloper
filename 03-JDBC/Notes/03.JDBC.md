### PreparedStatement in JDBC: Comprehensive Notes

**Introduction to JDBC**

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an API that allows Java applications to interact with a wide range of databases. It provides methods for querying and updating data in a database and is a key component in the Java platform. JDBC allows for a consistent interface for different types of relational databases, ensuring that developers can work with different databases without having to alter their code significantly.

**PreparedStatement Overview**

A `PreparedStatement` is a feature of the JDBC API that allows you to execute parameterized queries. Unlike a `Statement`, which requires you to build SQL queries as strings and concatenate variables directly into those strings, a `PreparedStatement` lets you define the structure of the query with placeholders and then supply the values for those placeholders separately. This approach offers several advantages, including improved performance, enhanced security, and easier maintenance.

### Key Features and Benefits of PreparedStatement

1. **Improved Performance**: Prepared statements are precompiled by the database, meaning the database prepares an execution plan that can be reused. This is particularly beneficial for queries that are executed multiple times with different parameters.

2. **Enhanced Security**: By using placeholders (`?`), `PreparedStatement` helps to mitigate SQL injection attacks. This is because user input is treated as data, not executable code.

3. **Parameterization**: It allows the same SQL statement to be executed with different parameters, which is both efficient and convenient.

4. **Maintainability**: Queries are easier to read and maintain since the SQL structure is clearly separated from the data.

### Creating and Using a PreparedStatement

1. **Establishing a Database Connection**: Before creating a `PreparedStatement`, you need to establish a connection to the database using the `DriverManager` class.

   ```java
   Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");
   ```

# Advantages of Prepared Statment
=================================
1.Performance is very high compared to Statment approach , bz query will be compiled only once .
2.Since we dont send the query multiple times b/w java application and database traffic will be reduced.
3.Input to the query need not be supplied at the beginning dynamiccaly we can supply the inputs.
4.inputs to the qyery can be supplied just like java style ,no need to perform formatting as per the DB specification.
5.Best suiltable for inserting Date values.
6.Best suitable for insertion BLOB's and CLOB's (Image and pdf files).
7.It prevents SQL Injection Attact .


Limitation of PreparedStatment
==============================

Statement stmt = connewction.createStaement();

    stmt.executeUpdate("insert into student values()...");
    stmt.executeQuery("select * from studeny")
    stmt.executeUpdate("delete from student where ...");

One Statment object can be used to execute multiple query


    PreparedStatment pstmt = connection.preparedStatment("Select * from student");
        pstmt.executeQuery();
    
One preparedStatement Object is restirc to only one query , that query can be execited multiple times with change in input 



The sql query without positional parameter (?) is called static query

The sql query with positional paramerer(?) is called dynamic query
