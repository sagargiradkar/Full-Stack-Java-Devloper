# Advantages of Prepared Statment
=================================
1.Performance is very high compared to Statment approach , bz query will be compiled only once .
2.Since we dont send the query multiple times b/w java application and database traffic will be reduced.
3.Input to the query need not be supplied at the beginning dynamiccaly we can supply the inputs.
4.inputs to the qyery can be supplied just like java style ,no need to perform formatting as per the DB specification.
5.Best suiltable for inserting Date values.
6.Best suitable for insertion BLOB's and CLOB's (Image and pdf files).
7.It prevents SQL Injection Attact .


Limitation of PreparedStatment
==============================

Statement stmt = connewction.createStaement();

    stmt.executeUpdate("insert into student values()...");
    stmt.executeQuery("select * from studeny")
    stmt.executeUpdate("delete from student where ...");

One Statment object can be used to execute multiple query


    PreparedStatment pstmt = connection.preparedStatment("Select * from student");
        pstmt.executeQuery();
    
One preparedStatement Object is restirc to only one query , that query can be execited multiple times with change in input 



The sql query without positional parameter (?) is called static query

The sql query with positional paramerer(?) is called dynamic query
