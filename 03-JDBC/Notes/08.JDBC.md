Sroll InSensetive ResultSet
    After getting resultSet if we are performing any operations in the database ,and if those chages are not reflecting to the resultSet ,such type of ResultSet are called as "Scroll insensetive ResultSet".

Scroll Sensitive ResultSet
    After getting resultSet if we are performimg any opertations in the database,and if those changes are getting reflecting to the resultSet , such type of ResultSet are called as "Scroll Sensitive ResultSet".
    public static final int TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE

NOte :
    When we make the resultSet as scrollSensitive , then we need to use resultSet.refreshRow() to get the updated records from the database.

# Updatable ResultSet

 It is possible to perform delete operation using resultSet without writing delete query

It is possible to perform insert operation using resultSet without writing insert query

    a.resultSet.moveToInsertRow()
    b.resultSet.updateXXX(int pos,Object value);
    c.resultSet.insertRow();

It is possible to perform update opeartion using resultSet without writing update query

    a.resultSet.getXXXX(int pos);
    b.resultSet.updateXXXX(int pos Object newValue);
    c.resultSet.updateRow();
