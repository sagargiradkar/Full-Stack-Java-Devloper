//Example-5: class level lock is applied
//->when thread is applying class level lock can other thread 
//  get same class level lock even though it is applying on
//  different lock?
//->No

//Note:2 here we have 2 objects, 2 thread. the thread which
//gets a chance applied class level lock so output is regular.

//->here nature of output is regular.

//Note:lock concept applicable only for objects and class
//types, but not for primitive types. if we try to do it 
//would result in compile time error saying "unexpected type".

//eg:: int x=10;
//synchronized(x){//CE: unexpected type found:int required:reference
//}
