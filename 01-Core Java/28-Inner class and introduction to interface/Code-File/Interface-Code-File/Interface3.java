//output: 
//Hey Implementation is given for m1
//Hey Implementation is given for m2














//I followed by name--> in order to know it is interface this 
//convention is followed by many developers

//Rules of overriding 
//1. Method signature never be changed
//2. retain same access modifier while overriding a method
